How are the declarations of the arrays set and set2 different
than how they would be declared in Java?

    In Java, the brackets are after the data type. Ex. int[] set = {1, 2, 3};

Which version of the code do you think is better? Why?

    I think the first way without pointers is better. Using pointers can easily
    confuse someone and is a lot harder to debug.

Dynamic memory allocation best practices:

    Make sure to delete the pointer when you are done.
    Also, set the pointer to nullptr as a precaution.
